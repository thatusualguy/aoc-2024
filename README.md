# Advent of Code 2024 - Kotlin

This year I've finally remembered to play Advent of Code[^aoc]. All solutions will be in [Kotlin][kotlin] language because it's cute!

Repository is created using [AoC Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] – An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
